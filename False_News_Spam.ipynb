            "On September 15, Hillary  apparently  held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea s apartment following her  incident,  passing more than one hospital on the way to  recuperate.  Did Hillary recover from her  incident  or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?Here is the first video of Hillary s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask  what the heck are those cameras in Hillary s  audience  pointing at?  If you look closely, it sure isn t Hillary!Watch this video first, and then the video below to get a closer analysis of what appears to be a phony rally for Hillary at https://twitter.com/WDFx2EU5/status/777263623915745280This stunning video takes the viewer through and shows step-by-step where the audience is faked:Here is the actual video from C-Span to prove nothing was doctored in the videos above.

            "AP News  The regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table, the one next to an old box television playing the news on mute.Steven Whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the Frosty Freeze, his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a half-century ago. Coffee is 50 cents a cup, refills 25 cents. The pot sits on the counter, and payment is based on the honor system.People like it that way, he thinks. It reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them, when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here, in God s Country, in this small county isolated in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.Everyone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking. And, recently, news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics   because Elliott County, a blue-collar union stronghold, voted for the Democrat in each and every presidential election for its 147-year existence.Until Donald Trump came along and promised to wind back the clock. He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse. There was a new energy about everybody here,  says Whitt. I still see it. Despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements, he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains, a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of Trump s white working-class base.The frenetic churn of the national news, the ceaseless Twitter taunts, the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen, rarely registering. When they do, Trump doesn t shoulder the blame   because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economic.It means God, guns, patriotism, saying  Merry Christmas  and not Happy Holidays. It means validation of their indignation about a changing nation: gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas. It means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world away.On those counts, they believe Trump has delivered, even if his promised blue-collar renaissance has not yet materialized. He s punching at all the people who let them down for so long   the presidential embodiment of their own discontent. He s already done enough to get my vote again, without a doubt, no question,  Wes Lewis, a retired pipefitter and one of Whitt s regulars, declares as he deals the day s first hand of cards.He thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life, and if they don t, he believes they would have if Democrats and Republicans and the media   all  crooked as a barrel of fishhooks    had gotten out of the way. What Lewis has now that he didn t have before Trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him. One thing I hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner,  says Whitt, 35.  He s a fighter. I think they like the bluntness of it. He plops down at an empty table next to the card game, drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes. Bill, bill, bill,  he reports to his wife, Chesla, who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together. He needs to run home and change of out his Frosty Freeze uniform, the first of several work ensembles he wears each day, and put on his second, a suit and tie. He also owns a local funeral home and he s the county coroner, elected as a Democrat.The Whitts, like many people here, cobble together a living with a couple jobs each   sometimes working 12 or 15 hours a day   because there aren t many options better than minimum wage. There s the school system, and a prison, and that s pretty much it. Outside of town, population 622, roads wind past rolling farms that used to grow tobacco before that industry crumbled too, then up into the hills of Appalachia, with its spectacular natural beauty and grinding poverty that has come to define this region in the American imagination.Whitt slides a medical bill across the table. Looks like this one is the new helmet,  he says, and his wife tears the envelope open and reports the debt: $3,995. They will add it to a growing pile that s already surpassed $40,000 since their son was born nine months ago with a rare condition. His skull was shaped like an egg, the bones fused together in places they shouldn t be. Tommy, their baby boy with big blue eyes, has now outgrown three of the helmets he s been required to wear after surgery so his bones grow back together like they should.They pay $800 a month for insurance. But when they took their baby to a surgeon in Cincinnati, they learned it was out of network. In-network hospitals offered only more invasive surgeries, so they opted to pay out of pocket. At the hospital they were told that if they d been on an insurance program for the poor, it would have all been free.This represents the cracks in America s institutions that drove Whitt, a lifelong Democrat, from supporting President Barack Obama to buying a  Make America Great Again  cap that he still keeps on top of the hutch. Many of their welfare-dependent neighbors, he believes, stay trapped in a cycle of handouts and poverty while hardworking taxpayers like him and his wife are stuck with the tab and can t get ahead. Where s the fairness in that?  he asks.But Whitt doesn t blame Trump for the failure this year to repeal the health care law and replace it with something better. He blames the  brick wall  in Washington, the politicians he sees as blocking everything Trump proposes while  small people  like them in small places like this are left again to languish.A third of people here live in poverty. Just 9 percent of adults have a college degree, but they always made up for that with backbreaking labor that workers traveled dozens of miles to neighboring counties or states to do, and those jobs have gotten harder to find.Many here blame global trade agreements and the  war on coal    environmental regulations designed by Obama s administration to curb carbon emissions   for the decline of mining and manufacturing jobs. When Trump bemoans the  American carnage  of lost factories and lost faith, it feels like he s talking to the people in these Appalachian hills. When he scraps dozens of regulations to the horror of environmentalists and says it means jobs are on the way, they embrace him.Coal has ticked up since Trump took office; mining companies have added 1,200 jobs across the country since his inauguration, more than 180 of them in Kentucky. But industry analysts say that was tied largely to market forces and dismiss Trump s repeated pledges to resuscitate the coal industry as pie in the sky. Coal has been on the decline for many decades for many reasons outside of regulation: far cheaper natural gas, mechanization, thinning Appalachian seams. With the opposition he s had, I think he s pulling the plow pretty good,  offers Wes Lewis from the card table. A few months ago, he says, he saw four brand-new coal rigs going through town.  For the longest time, under Obama, all we saw were trucks being pulled on wreckers, because people turned belly up, they went broke. Lewis says he s heard about friends of friends being called back to work. He s noticed new trucks in people s driveways, too, which he takes as evidence that his neighbors are feeling confident about their futures. These tiny signs stack up to him as proof. Lewis fishes the tag out of the bib of his overalls:  Made in Mexico,  it reads. Trump s bringing them back,  he says.Lewis, a registered Democrat, trusts Trump because he trusts his values. And because of that, he trusts Trump s other promises   so strongly he can t think of anything that would shake that faith in him. If the factories and mines don t come back, he ll blame the opposition. If there isn t a wall on the Mexico border, he says, it won t be because Trump didn t try. If investigators find his campaign colluded with Russians, it s because so many people are so determined to bring him down.Go HERE to read entire story.      4\n",
            "Because there wouldn t be any outrage over a  white kids only  field trip to a local college would there?Parents criticized Indiana school officials Thursday for a trip planned to local colleges that was only offered to black third-graders, ABC 57 reported.School officials defended the trip, saying the outing sends a positive message to black students who may believe the prospect of college is out of reach. We take them to a college campus, have them meet African-American students, modeling the idea that as a black person, college is a great place,  Dr. G. David Moss, the head of the African-American services at the South Bend Community Schools Corporation, told the station.The initiative has been criticized by parents in the community, not because of its ambitions, but because it excludes students with other backgrounds.One parent whose son is going on the trip told the station that she believes  all kids should be going. Moss told the station that he did not mean to offend anyone with the trips, but said he was hired to  look at the issues facing African-American kids  in the community.Via: FOX News

            "Donald Trump s response to the horrific massacre in Orlando   the worst in American history   was nothing short of disgraceful. Instead of expressing condolences, he instead congratulated himself on being right about Muslims and used the tragedy as an opportunity to double down on his bigoted plan to ban Muslims from the United States. HBO s host of Real Time, Bill Maher, wasted no time in ripping Trump a new one on that, and took it a step further and told his viewers what we all already know: Donald Trump is not just an offensive blowhard, he s also an amazing narcissist. Maher began with Trump s racist attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is  presiding over his Trump University case: The judge thing looked selfish. There is no constituency for Trump University except for Donald Trump. And then the first thing out of his mouth after Orlando was,  I was right.  He looks like what he is   a narcissist. One of Maher s panel members, Business Insider Senior Editor Josh Barro, pointed out that the American people have shown better sense than we realize  when it comes to Trump s ridiculously offensive Twitter brag regarding Orlando. He continued: It turns out Americans don t like blatantly racist attacks on the judiciary that also signal that a president might use his own power to support his businesses and defeat his political opponents through untoward things. And then the response to the shooting. I think there had been this idea that if there was terrorism that it would be good for Trump. Bill Maher went so far as to say that this week ended Trump s White House ambitions: I see it as, this was the week it ended. I don t think I m the only one, because most of the Republicans who were caught on camera this week basically said,  I don t want to talk about it. Of course they don t want to talk about it. What the hell can they say to what Trump gets up to at his rallies and on national television on an almost daily basis? Hell, the man even celebrated his 70th birthday this week by accusing the sitting president of treason. The Republicans who do speak out are the brave ones, such as the former Bush adviser who called him out for what he is   ignorant   after those remarks that suggest that President Obama was a terrorist sympathizer.Hopefully, Maher is right, and this particularly horrible week in Trump Land has effectively squashed any chance he has at ruining America as President Trump.Watch the clip

            "We all know by now that House Speaker Paul Ryan is a spineless weasel. He is clearly uncomfortable with the idea of a President Trump, and yet he endorsed the great orange one anyway, and no matter how outrageously offensive Trump becomes, no matter how many times Ryan has to distance himself from Trump s remarks, he still says he s a Donald Trump supporter. Well, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson is now calling Ryan out for making such a grave mistake, and wants him to un-endorse Donald Trump.Johnson sat down with CNN to express his views on Ryan s Trump endorsement, and he had nothing good to say about where the House Speaker is right now. Johnson said: I think Paul Ryan has an opportunity here to say,  Look, I made a mistake.  I m not saying that results in an endorsement of me, but come on, the statements that he s making  he s made 100 statements that would disqualify any other presidential candidate from running and yet all you have to do is turn the page and tomorrow it will be 102. Host Erin Burneet pointed out that 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney had once floated the idea of supporting a Libertarian ticket, but had reservations about Johnson s policies, particularly his support of legal marijuana nationwide. Romney said that weed  makes people stupid.  Johnson disagreed, and admitted to taking a toke or two himself, and said: I do not agree with that. As someone who has used marijuana, I do not agree with that. What Gary Johnson doesn t seem to understand, though, is that Paul Ryan is not Mitt Romney. Paul Ryan is a dyed in the wool, loyal die hard GOPer till death do him and that wreck of a party part   even if it means propping Trump up and letting him burn the world down.Give it up, Gary. As much as I agree with you, I think you need to realize that Paul Ryan will never, ever disavow his annointed nominee.Watch the clip below, via The Hill:Featured image via William B.

            "When Jared Yates Sexton, a professor of creative writing at Georgia Southern University, decided to attend a Trump rally in North Carolina, he probably wasn t expecting a drunken free-for-all more appropriate to an out-of-control frat party than a presidential rally. Yet, that s what he saw, and he live-tweeted the entire event, giving the world a chilling look at what Trump supporters are really like when they think they re just among  friends. Upon trying to get in, Sexton saw how security treated people:Trump event like a security state. Just watched a girl get denied for being  too alternative.  Jared Sexton Sexton (@JYSexton) June 14, 2016Sexton himself also got told something strange: Just got told I don t  look right.  Jared Sexton Sexton (@JYSexton) June 14, 2016But these two tweets just barely scratch the surface. After Trump took the stage, people shouting the word  Bitch!  was common whenever Hillary Clinton s name came up. Homophobic hate speech ran rampant as Trump spoke about the Orlando massacre. A protester cowered in fear after another was escorted out, with the crowd chanting  Hurt him, hurt him,  even as King Donald told security not to hurt him.Lots of people yelling bitch at Clinton s mention  Jared Sexton Sexton (@JYSexton) June 14, 2016 Crowd member just shouted  gays had it coming  Jared Sexton Sexton (@JYSexton) June 14, 2016Trump says not to hurt protestor, several chant HURT HIM HURT HIM  Jared Sexton Sexton (@JYSexton) June 14, 2016 There s a protestor next to me and he s scared to death  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) June 14, 2016If you thought Trump himself was scary, he s nothing compared to his fans. Sexton s full account of that night included horrors such as this: The gays had it coming [in Orlando]!  a man shouted and gazed back at the guy who d called Hillary a bitch. They met eyes, shared a smile, a look of recognition.As if it were some kind of joke.As if 49 of his fellow Americans 49 living, breathing human beings hadn t just been mowed down. Elsewhere, a father was telling his son all about Bill Clinton s presidency: I walked behind a father explaining the shirt to his ten-year-old son by saying the former secretary of the state, the first female presidential nominee of a major political party, had  let her husband have all kinds of oral sex in the White House.' Awhile back, Trump said that Hillary had enabled her husband s adultery while he was president, as if that somehow makes her both less of a woman, and unqualified to be president. Trump doesn t go after anyone s policy positions the way a presidential candidate should. He attacks his opponents personally, like the schoolyard bully he is, and his fans are doing the same.That a father thinks it s okay teach his 10-year old how to be the same childish bully as Trump is just sick.But the worst is yet to come. Trump rallies are full of drunken, brawling racists who say things like: You can t trust Latinos. Some maybe, but not most. Immigrants aren t people, honey. You know them crazy black girls, how they are. Sexton s Twitter feed is full of sarcastic humor, but what he live-tweeted from that rally in Greensboro, NC, was devoid of his sharp wit. And it s no wonder, because he also wrote this in his recount of the event (if it can even be called an  event ): Sickened, I got in my car and watched in the rearview as a group of college boys tailgated out of their pickup  That s when I realized what had been there all along. This campaign, whose success has long been attributed to the forgotten working and middle classes, the so-called Silent Majority, has been, and always will be, an unholy alliance between the Hateful and the Privileged, the former always on a never-ending search for new venues for their poison and the latter enjoying, for the first time since Reagan s  80s, an opportunity to get out and step on some necks in public. Any reasonable person would find themselves sickened at a Trump rally if this is normal, and given what s happened to protesters, members of the press, and others, this is normal. It s clear that the only thing Donald Trump is truly capable of is bringing out the worst of humanity, which isn t surprising considering he himself embodies the worst of humanity.Featured image by Gerardo Mora/Getty Images                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
            "The Republican Party is fractured, and divisions are deeper than ever thanks to one Donald J. Trump. Some Republicans feel the party needs to unify behind Trump now, but others, particularly Senators in tight races, know what Trump is doing to their re-election chances. As such, an old friend has come out of the woodwork to shill for them: Former President George W. Bush.George the Lesser, along with Jeb! and their father, George the Greater, will not support Trump for president. A former spokesman for W., Freddy Ford, told NBC News why W. would hop back into the cesspool of conservative U.S. politics after such a long hiatus: President Bush believes that it s critical to keep the Senate in Republican hands. He is actively helping some senators in tight races who are strong leaders and share timeless conservative values. Ford also told The New York Times: Friends say that the former president is deeply bothered by Mr. Trump s campaign message, especially his derogatory remarks about Muslims and immigrants. At the event with Mr. McCain, Mr. Bush stressed the importance of preserving the Republican-held Senate as a  check and balance  on the White House, suggesting that such a check was needed, whether the next president is Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. In other words, maintaining what little relevance the party has left is more important than trying to defeat Trump at this point, because the only way to defeat Trump himself is to endorse Hillary. As a die-hard Republican, George the Lesser won t do that. So he s gone out and hosted fundraisers for vulnerable Senators like John McCain (R-AZ) and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), and he s got three more planned for Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Ron Johnson (R-NC), and Rob Portman (R-OH).The GOP is defending many more Senate seats than the Democrats this year, which is part of their fear that Trump will cost them everything but the House, and the only reason they d hang onto the House is ridiculous gerrymandering.This hasn t gone unnoticed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which reacted to this news with a statement sent to The Hill: Republicans are so desperate for people to forget that they ve pledged their allegiance to Donald Trump that they are now campaigning with the architect of a disastrous foreign policy who wanted to privatize Social Security and left office with the economy losing nearly 800,000 jobs a month. Obviously, they re scoffing at this particular strategy, as well they should. It s an odd move for George the Lesser, and shows the party s growing fears over The Donald and what he really stands for.Featured image by David Cannon/Getty Images

            "21st Century Wire says It s not that far away. Guess who wants to run for president in 2020?Just before the New Year bell rung, the embattled Chicago Mayor Rahm Israel Emanuel (D) was forced to cut short his family vacation in Cuba, and headed back to the windy city after yet another embarrassing police shooting last week which claimed two lives as police responding to a  domestic disturbance  call killed  19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, an engineering student at Northern Illinois University, and bystander 55-year-old Betti Jones, a grandmother.Last week, 100 people, family and activists, held a vigil for the victims. The Mayor has attempted a sort of mea culpa this time, but the public is not buying it, mainly because this was the second major high-profile police shooting incident to rock city hall in the last month. TROUBLE IN HIS KEEP: The LaQuan McDonald shooting has rattled the  dynasty potential  of Chicago s Rahm Emanuel.Currently serving his second term in office, the 56-year-old mayor is going from one crisis to the next, as tensions continue to simmer after the initial controversy, the killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald who was shot 16 times by city police on camera   which prompted angry mobs demanding  The King  step down.There could be a political price to pay for all of this. Not only are #BlackLivesMatter on the rampage over these latest shooting events, but also LeGrier s mother, Janet Cooksey, appeared on national TV last Sunday at a news conference, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the face of Mayor Emanuel with the words  Rahm Failed Us. Throughout the debacle, Emmanuel has not given in to the public pressure, even though his approval rating has plummeted 20% since hostilities began. On top of this, Chicago has earned the reputation of  murder capital of America , despite the mayor s staunch liberal policy of  gun-free zones  across the city which some critics credit towards creating a criminal s paradise. The Mayor is already on shaky ground. Only last winter, Emanuel narrowly survived a close run-off election to keep his job in office.All of this has the potential to cast a shadow over Emanuel s political future, which is likely to include a Democratic Party presidential run in 2020. It s reported that Emanuel already has a substantial campaign war chest ready to go, billions of dollars in fact, thanks to some very wealthy backers. If Emanuel does go ahead with the 2020 plan, the driving force behind his campaign will be his Hollywood mogul brother, Ari Emanuel, who will spare no expense in terms of PR, marketing and advertising for his brother s political drive to the White House. Part of the newly found Emanuel family fortune derives from their early investment in the virtual taxi service sensation, Uber, with the Emanuel investment estimated to be valued over $1 billion alone. This is not without controversy however, as it was Mayor Rahm Emanuel s deregulation of Chicago s taxi industry that helped Uber shares to skyrocket in value. Critics are saying that there was a conflict of interest there, but in today s seedy political environment of insider trading and open criminality, it might be hard for any politician to pull rank over that issue. Add to this the potential hundreds of millions more in donations that Emanuel will receive from Jewish property tycoon Sheldon Adelson, and also from Jewish billionaire and Emanuel s fellow anti-gun advocate, Michael Bloomberg   and all in the interests of serving Israel, and you can see how Emanuel could be viewed as a 2020 Democratic front-runner already.The Mayor emerged on to the DC sewer scene as part of the Clinton-Obama Chicago political machine. He s been described by AFP s Victor Thorn as,  More sinister than Karl Rove and potentially deadlier than Dick  Darth Vader  Cheney . Back when Emanuel was Barack Obama s chief of staff in 2008, many commentators remarked on his psychopathic behavior, including his frightening Machiavellian exhibition in a White House meeting where he said the administration s political enemies need to,  Die, die, die! , as he stabbed the table in anger, reportedly using either a pen, or letter opener (regardless, that s a bit scary). Enough to scare the American people considering this is a man who most likely has his eyes on the White House. DUAL LOYALTIES: Rahm Emanuel might have a hard to time putting US interests ahead of Netanyahu s.The other strange bone of contention about Emanuel as a candidate is that he is reportedly a dual citizen (although its believed he gave up his Israeli citizenship at 19 years old) who shares a national identity between the United States and Israel, and actual served in the IDF briefly after college. According to Mondoweiss,  Emanuel left when the Gulf War broke out, in order to volunteer in the IDF. He served in one of Israel s northern bases until the war ended, and upon his return to the US became Clinton s advisor in the White House for almost eight years. Emanuel can often be seen in the presence of Israel leader and Zionist extremist, Bibi Netanyahu, which raises the real prospect of Tel Aviv finally having its very own US president embedded in the White House.The fundamental question here is: when it comes down to the crunch, which country s interest would Emanuel be more loyal towards, the US, or Israel. Contrary to popular Republican belief sets, you cannot wear allegiance to both, because no matter how hard the Israel Lobby tries to portray it   both countries have very radically different national and social interests.If this issue sinks any further down the cesspit of public outrage, expect Emanuel s Hollywood PR machine to go into overdrive.READ MORE ISRAEL NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Israel Files                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

            "On September 15, Hillary  apparently  held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea s apartment following her  incident,  passing more than one hospital on the way to  recuperate.

            "Because there wouldn t be any outrage over a  white kids only  field trip to a local college would there?Parents criticized Indiana school officials Thursday for a trip planned to local colleges that was only offered to black third-graders, ABC 57 reported.School officials defended the trip, saying the outing sends a positive message to black students who may believe the prospect of college is out of reach. We take them to a college campus, have them meet African-American students, modeling the idea that as a black person, college is a great place,  Dr. G. David Moss, the head of the African-American services at the South Bend Community Schools Corporation, told the station.The initiative has been criticized by parents in the community, not because of its ambitions, but because it excludes students with other backgrounds.One parent whose son is going on the trip told the station that she believes  all kids should be going. Moss told the station that he did not mean to offend anyone with the trips, but said he was hired to  look at the issues facing African-American kids  in the community.Via: FOX News                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             4\n",
            "Things didn t go as well as Nicholle had hoped and now, she s lashing out at the owner of the billboard company who was inundated with calls from angry residents.Rouse & Revolt owner Nicholle Lewis told Newsweek that she didn t sleep much last night. Her phone wouldn t stop going off with the persistent buzzing of death threats for her sign, which stylizes the number 45 into a swastika and features Trump posed in a Hitler-esque stance. I m living in a small, podunk red town and I m already getting death threats,  said Lewis, whose store is in right-leaning Chico, population 90,000.  My business has completely floundered. Overnight I had more one-star reviews than all the reviews I ve received in a year. The sign was up for less than 24 hours before Stott Outdoor Advertising took it down amid a backlash that featured online attacks.But Lewis said she s standing behind her beliefs. I don t necessarily think that just because I m a business doesn t mean I can t mix my beliefs,  Lewis said.  That s a common misconception that you can t mix politics and business.   I have a platform and I m going to use it. Lewis has used the billboard at the corner of Third Avenue and Mangrove Avenue all year, though this is the first time she s made it political. He is not presidential, he is not a president,  Lewis said.  He is a celebrity who was born into money. And he s a Nazi sympathizer. I am going to stand behind my beliefs regardless. Lewis said she has been getting some support, too.Lewis got slammed by bad reviews on her store, Rouse and Revolt Facebook page, as well as her personal Facebook page, where she posted this video. In the video, Lewis pleas with liberals to make false claims against the sign company, as a payback because she s been hit with bad reviews.

            "For months, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has claimed that his innovative use of social media and his vast personal fortune will allow him to dominate Hillary Clinton and the Democrats in the fall. But in reality, as the key fight in the battleground states that will likely determine the next president begins, Trump is getting destroyed by Secretary Clinton s campaign and allies.Democrats have $23 million worth of advertising on the air; Trump has NONE.Every single 2016 presidential TV ad currently airing in a battleground state is either from Hillary Clinton s campaign or the Democratic outside groups supporting her.The opposition, by contrast, hasn t spent a dime in these same battlegrounds   whether it s Donald Trump s campaign or Republican-leaning Super PACs.So far in June, Clinton and the outside groups backing her have spent a total of $23.3 million on ads in the battleground states of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, according to ad-spending data from SMG Delta.By comparison in 2012, the advertising in battleground states at this point was 54%-46% in favor of President Obama against Mitt Romney. Even with that single digit edge, Obama went on to win every battleground state and secured a landslide in the electoral college for his second term.Despite having the same amount of time to plan for the election and a primary that wrapped up about a month before the Democrats were done, Republicans have still lagged behind. They don t have as many campaign staff on the ground in key swing states, as Trump often didn t set up staff there and has dismantled much of what he had.Trump has also had issues with raising money, as reports indicate he has been too lazy to make the critical calls to the financiers that finance party activities and advertising. Despite his claim to be a  billionaire,  there has been little sign that Trump is actually willing to put his own money where his mouth is and finance his presidential campaign.Behind the scenes reporting has shown Republican insiders worried about their inability to compete this fall, while major Republican donors like the Koch Brothers are reluctant about donating to a campaign that could lose in a major landslide.Featured image via YouTube                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
            "Mike Hagan has a used car dealership and repair shop in Rochester, New Hampshire and is running a very odd and frankly irresponsible promotion. He s offering a free AR-15 to people who come buy a car from him, because  Murika.Hagan is a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan. He knows what these kinds of guns can do, and yet, according to WFTV 9, he s not worried about whether any of these guns might be used to murder people later on. Thus far, he s given away four of the weapons, along with a 9mm Beretta, which is an alternative for people who don t want an AR-15, and he thinks his promotion is a wild success.This kind of promotion is bad enough, and to refuse to end it following a horrific tragedy like Orlando is just plain insensitive and cruel. The gun nuts apparently don t see it that way, though. They ve taken to Facebook to celebrate Hagan s promotion, lest the  evil libruls  finally come to confiscate everyone s guns.              There has been some backlash, though, not just on social media, but also from a couple of people that NH1 TV spoke to. At least there are least still some sane people out there: To me that s just getting more of the nut jobs out there doing harm to more people that don t deserve it. My opinion, military and police are the only ones that should have them. Hagan has partnered with a local gun dealer to run his promotion, and customers have to go there to go through a background check and get the weapons. Apparently, that makes it all okay because it means he knows he can t give them out like they re candy.Besides that, he believes that the people who take advantage of this promotion will be fully responsible, because everyone knows that all the people who obtain their guns legally are very responsible gun owners   oh wait. Omar Mateen, and so many other mass shooters, bought their guns legally, not to mention all the idiots who have no clue what gun safety is, and end up accidentally shooting someone to death.Hagan claims he won t extend the offer to someone from whom he gets a bad feeling. So, what, he s telepathic and knows who has bad intentions? Horse hockey. This is still sick, it s still irresponsible, and it s still cruel and insensitive. It also demonstrates just how sick as a society we ve become where this kind of thing is seen as something to celebrate by so many.Featured image via screen capture from NH1-TV report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
            "Repeat after me: There are no gun  accidents. There. Are. No. Gun. Accidents. People all too often die unintentionally   like when  responsible  gun owners leave their weapons lying around and children find them   and while these situations are often called accidents, the true issue is negligence. Simply put, nothing would have happened in many, if not most  accidental  shootings if the gun wasn t present in the first place   or, at minimum, if the owners of the weapons actually cared about gun safety.The NRA regularly promotes the lie that all people who own firearms are  responsible     good guys with guns  who stand ready to leap into action at the first sign of danger (if they manage to help out without shooting the victim of a crime in the head, that is).Once again, one of the Saviors of Mankind  accidentally  discharged a firearm and took another human s life. On Saturday, a gun store owner in Amelia, Ohio was murdered (yes, murdered) when someone taking a concealed weapons class was negligent with his gun. An unnamed participant (whose identity, as is normal, is being protected) in a class at the KayJay Gun Shop   someone who already owned a gun and wanted to carry it around with him everywhere he or she goes was practicing weapon malfunction drills with a handgun that was, for some reason, loaded during a training exercise. The weapon fired and struck shop owner James Baker in the neck.Friends describe Baker, whose shop repairs and engraves firearms, has authorization to manufacture weapons, and is licensed to sell military-grade guns like the one that was used to slaughter fifty people in Orlando, Florida, as a  special  person who was  loved by the whole community. As always, the media and police are treating this as though it was an actual accident, like tripping while walking down the sidewalk. The reality is that this was no accident, and it is time that we stop treating it as such. This was murder. Sure, the person did not intend for it to happen   just like if someone is negligent while driving a car and runs someone over. In the latter case, at least the killer would be charged with a crime   something that rarely happens in  accidental  shootings.The investigation is still ongoing, but we can expect two things to happen: no charges will be filed (after all, it is already being called an  accident ), and Second Amendment advocates will flock to excuse this  accident  before forgetting about it entirely.Perhaps it s time that we end the madness. Maybe, just maybe, we need to reconsider if the Second Amendment should exist in the first place.Watch a report on this latest  accident  below:Featured image via screengrab                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
            "This is why John McCain really regretted blaming President Obama for the Orlando mass shooting.On Thursday, McCain told reporters in a Senate hallway that President Obama is  directly responsible  for the mass shooting in Orlando that resulted in 50 people being killed and 53 people being wounded. Barack Obama is directly responsible for it, because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al-Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama s failures,  McCain said.Reporters gave McCain a fair chance to walk his comments back but he only repeated his claim. He pulled everybody out of Iraq, and I predicted at the time that ISIS would go unchecked, and there would be attacks on the United States of America. It s a matter of record, so he is directly responsible. You can listen to McCain s remarks below:Not long after, McCain issued a statement claiming he  misspoke  even though he made his remarks twice. I misspoke,  McCain said. I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama s national security decisions, not the President himself. As I have said, President Obama s decision to completely withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 led to the rise of ISIL. I and others have long warned that the failure of the President s policy to deny ISIL safe haven would allow the terrorist organization to inspire, plan, direct or conduct attacks on the United States and Europe as they have done in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino and now Orlando. Of course, McCain is wrong about President Obama pulling the troops out of Iraq. That was a decision made by President Bush in 2008. President Obama merely honored the agreement signed by the former president.But McCain could be the former Senator from Arizona because of his inflammatory accusation against President Obama.As it turns out, donations have been pouring in for his opponent Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick to the tune of at least $100,000 alone since McCain made the remarks. McCain angered many people with his disrespectful comments about President Obama and so they are responding by supporters his challenger.In addition, a poll touted by Kirkpatrick s campaign in the wake of McCain s remarks shows him losing to her by two points.Kirkpatrick spokesman D.B. Mitchell slammed McCain for his remarks and urged people to help oust him from Congress. John McCain s reckless and appalling comments about the Orlando mass shooting disappointed thousands of Arizonans and people from across the nation,  said Kirkpatrick spokesman D.B. Mitchell.  But his actions are just further proof that after 33 years in Washington McCain has changed, and now Americans are witnessing that he s no longer a  maverick.  Arizonans know it s time for new principled leadership, and that s why Ann Kirkpatrick saw the largest one-day fundraising number of the campaign. We need a senator who will put our national security before partisan politics. We must do everything we can to elect Ann to the Senate and we are asking you to make a donation today. John McCain is currently facing one of the toughest re-election efforts for a Republican this year. Losing his race could very well tip the balance in the Senate and give the majority back to the Democratic Party.You can donate to Kirkpatrick s campaign here.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
            "21st Century Wire says It s not that far away. Guess who wants to run for president in 2020?Just before the New Year bell rung, the embattled Chicago Mayor Rahm Israel Emanuel (D) was forced to cut short his family vacation in Cuba, and headed back to the windy city after yet another embarrassing police shooting last week which claimed two lives as police responding to a  domestic disturbance  call killed  19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, an engineering student at Northern Illinois University, and bystander 55-year-old Betti Jones, a grandmother.Last week, 100 people, family and activists, held a vigil for the victims. The Mayor has attempted a sort of mea culpa this time, but the public is not buying it, mainly because this was the second major high-profile police shooting incident to rock city hall in the last month. TROUBLE IN HIS KEEP: The LaQuan McDonald shooting has rattled the  dynasty potential  of Chicago s Rahm Emanuel.Currently serving his second term in office, the 56-year-old mayor is going from one crisis to the next, as tensions continue to simmer after the initial controversy, the killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald who was shot 16 times by city police on camera   which prompted angry mobs demanding  The King  step down.There could be a political price to pay for all of this. Not only are #BlackLivesMatter on the rampage over these latest shooting events, but also LeGrier s mother, Janet Cooksey, appeared on national TV last Sunday at a news conference, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the face of Mayor Emanuel with the words  Rahm Failed Us. Throughout the debacle, Emmanuel has not given in to the public pressure, even though his approval rating has plummeted 20% since hostilities began. On top of this, Chicago has earned the reputation of  murder capital of America , despite the mayor s staunch liberal policy of  gun-free zones  across the city which some critics credit towards creating a criminal s paradise. The Mayor is already on shaky ground. Only last winter, Emanuel narrowly survived a close run-off election to keep his job in office.All of this has the potential to cast a shadow over Emanuel s political future, which is likely to include a Democratic Party presidential run in 2020. It s reported that Emanuel already has a substantial campaign war chest ready to go, billions of dollars in fact, thanks to some very wealthy backers. If Emanuel does go ahead with the 2020 plan, the driving force behind his campaign will be his Hollywood mogul brother, Ari Emanuel, who will spare no expense in terms of PR, marketing and advertising for his brother s political drive to the White House. Part of the newly found Emanuel family fortune derives from their early investment in the virtual taxi service sensation, Uber, with the Emanuel investment estimated to be valued over $1 billion alone. This is not without controversy however, as it was Mayor Rahm Emanuel s deregulation of Chicago s taxi industry that helped Uber shares to skyrocket in value. Critics are saying that there was a conflict of interest there, but in today s seedy political environment of insider trading and open criminality, it might be hard for any politician to pull rank over that issue. Add to this the potential hundreds of millions more in donations that Emanuel will receive from Jewish property tycoon Sheldon Adelson, and also from Jewish billionaire and Emanuel s fellow anti-gun advocate, Michael Bloomberg   and all in the interests of serving Israel, and you can see how Emanuel could be viewed as a 2020 Democratic front-runner already.The Mayor emerged on to the DC sewer scene as part of the Clinton-Obama Chicago political machine. He s been described by AFP s Victor Thorn as,  More sinister than Karl Rove and potentially deadlier than Dick  Darth Vader  Cheney . Back when Emanuel was Barack Obama s chief of staff in 2008, many commentators remarked on his psychopathic behavior, including his frightening Machiavellian exhibition in a White House meeting where he said the administration s political enemies need to,  Die, die, die! , as he stabbed the table in anger, reportedly using either a pen, or letter opener (regardless, that s a bit scary). Enough to scare the American people considering this is a man who most likely has his eyes on the White House. DUAL LOYALTIES: Rahm Emanuel might have a hard to time putting US interests ahead of Netanyahu s.The other strange bone of contention about Emanuel as a candidate is that he is reportedly a dual citizen (although its believed he gave up his Israeli citizenship at 19 years old) who shares a national identity between the United States and Israel, and actual served in the IDF briefly after college. According to Mondoweiss,  Emanuel left when the Gulf War broke out, in order to volunteer in the IDF. He served in one of Israel s northern bases until the war ended, and upon his return to the US became Clinton s advisor in the White House for almost eight years. Emanuel can often be seen in the presence of Israel leader and Zionist extremist, Bibi Netanyahu, which raises the real prospect of Tel Aviv finally having its very own US president embedded in the White House.The fundamental question here is: when it comes down to the crunch, which country s interest would Emanuel be more loyal towards, the US, or Israel. Contrary to popular Republican belief sets, you cannot wear allegiance to both, because no matter how hard the Israel Lobby tries to portray it   both countries have very radically different national and social interests.If this issue sinks any further down the cesspit of public outrage, expect Emanuel s Hollywood PR machine to go into overdrive.READ MORE ISRAEL NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Israel Files      1\n",
